# CrumbWorks - Offline Recipe PWA

A mobile-first Progressive Web App for managing and cooking from recipes offline. Built with React, TypeScript, and designed specifically for home cooks.

## Features

- 🍳 **Import recipes by URL** - Automatically extracts ingredients, steps, and metadata from recipe websites
- 📤 **Share to CrumbWorks** - Share recipe URLs directly from your browser to CrumbWorks (when installed as PWA)
- 📱 **Mobile-first PWA** - Optimized for iPhone Safari with proper PWA support
- 🔄 **Recipe scaling** - Scale ingredients with clean fraction display (½×, 1.5×, 2×, etc.)
- ✅ **Cook mode** - Check off ingredients and steps with temporary session persistence (72h TTL)
- 📴 **Offline-first** - Works completely offline once recipes are imported
- 🎨 **Kitchen-themed design** - Warm, cozy color palette with excellent readability
- 🖨️ **Print-friendly** - Clean printouts without UI clutter
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL Backend** - Server-side recipe storage with PostgreSQL database
- 🚀 **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated Docker builds via GitHub Actions to GHCR

## Production Deployment

This app is designed to be deployed via the central `modern-server-infra` repository which handles:
- Traefik reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS
- PostgreSQL database (`crumb_db`)
- Redis caching layer
- Monitoring and observability

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker image built and pushed to GHCR (automatic via GitHub Actions)
- Infrastructure repo cloned and configured
- GHCR authentication configured

**Deployment Steps:**

1. **Pull the latest image**
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/yancmo1/crumb-recipe-pwa:latest
   ```

2. **Configure in infrastructure**
   - Add service definition to `modern-server-infra/compose/docker-compose.yml`
   - Set environment variables (database connection, port 5554)
   - Ensure database `crumb_db` exists

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   cd modern-server-infra/compose
   docker compose up -d crumb
   ```

4. **Access the app**
   - Via Traefik: `https://crumb.yourdomain.com`

### Local Development Setup

If you want to run without Docker for development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server (frontend only)
npm run dev

# In another terminal, start the import server
npm run server
```

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- API server: `http://localhost:3000`

### Docker Dev (hot reload)

If you want a Docker-based dev environment (useful for testing changes locally before committing), you can run the full stack with hot reload:

- Frontend (Vite): `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:5555`
- Postgres (optional, for debugging): `localhost:5434`

This uses `docker-compose.dev.yml` and points the Vite `/api` proxy at the backend container.

Run it:

```bash
npm run docker:dev
```

Stop it:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom kitchen color palette
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Dexie** for IndexedDB storage
- **Workbox** for PWA and offline capabilities

### Backend
- **Express.js** server for recipe import API
- **Cheerio** + **@mozilla/readability** for HTML parsing
- **JSON-LD Schema.org** extraction with heuristic fallbacks
- Ingredient parsing with fraction support

### Storage
- **IndexedDB** for recipes and ephemeral cook sessions
- **localStorage** for app settings
- No cloud dependencies - everything works offline

## Usage

### Importing Recipes

#### Method 1: Manual URL Import
1. Click the "+" button on the home screen
2. Paste a recipe URL (supports most cooking sites)
3. The app will extract ingredients, steps, images, and metadata
4. Recipe is stored locally for offline access

#### Method 2: Share from Browser (PWA only)
1. Install CrumbWorks as a PWA on your device
2. Browse to any recipe webpage
3. Tap the Share button in your browser
4. Select "CrumbWorks" from the share menu
5. The recipe URL will be automatically populated in the import page
6. Tap "Import Recipe" to complete the import

**Note:** The Web Share Target feature requires CrumbWorks to be installed as a PWA. On iOS, use Safari's "Add to Home Screen" option. On Android Chrome, use "Install app" or "Add to Home screen".

### Cooking Mode

1. Open a recipe
2. Click "Start Cooking" to begin a session
3. Check off ingredients and steps as you cook
4. Session persists for 72 hours with option to extend
5. Use the scale controls to adjust serving sizes

### Tested Recipe Sources

The import engine has been validated with:
- [The Clever Carrot - Sourdough Pancakes](https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2020/05/homemade-fluffy-sourdough-pancakes/)
- [Pantry Mama - Cinnamon Roll Focaccia](https://www.pantrymama.com/sourdough-cinnamon-roll-focaccia-bread/)
- [Farmhouse on Boone - Oatmeal Cream Pies](https://www.farmhouseonboone.com/homemade-sourdough-oatmeal-cream-pies/)

## Deployment

### Docker Production Deploy

```bash
# Build and run
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

# With custom SSL (update nginx.conf paths)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d nginx
```

### Ubuntu Server Deploy

1. **Install Docker**:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

2. **Setup SSL with Let's Encrypt**:
```bash
# Install certbot
sudo apt install certbot

# Get certificates (replace with your domain)
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com

# Update nginx.conf with cert paths
# ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
# ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;
```

3. **Deploy**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url> /opt/crumb
cd /opt/crumb
docker-compose up -d
```

4. **Auto-renewal** (crontab):
```bash
0 12 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet && docker-compose restart nginx
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Port
# - Local dev default (when running `npm run server`): 3000
# - Container / infra-new recommended: 5554
PORT=5554

# Node environment

### Key Components

- **Library** (`/`) - Recipe collection with search
- **Import** (`/import`) - URL-based recipe import
- **Recipe Detail** (`/recipe/:id`) - Cook mode with scaling
- **Settings** (`/settings`) - Data management and preferences

### State Management

- **Recipe Store** - Recipe CRUD operations
- **Cook Session Store** - Ephemeral cooking state with TTL
- **Settings Store** - Persisted user preferences

### Recipe Import Pipeline

1. **Fetch HTML** with proper user agent
2. **JSON-LD extraction** - Primary method for schema.org recipes
3. **Microdata fallback** - Secondary structured data extraction
4. **Print version** - Attempt cleaner version if available
5. **Heuristic parsing** - Readability + pattern matching as last resort
6. **Ingredient tokenization** - Parse amounts, units, and notes

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# E2E tests (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e

# Test recipe import
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/import \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2020/05/homemade-fluffy-sourdough-pancakes/"}'
```
